* Official rust ffi support: https://docs.rs/ffi-support/0.4.2/ffi_support/ (pretty useful)
* FFI crate: https://crates.io/crates/ffi-support (unsure of its imp to me)

### Mozilla Impl-ing FFI
* Their blogpost: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/crossing-the-rust-ffi-frontier-with-protocol-buffers/
* moz/as: https://github.com/mozilla/application-services
* Useful section of trailing repo [here](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/tree/72b827c3e0f883163762857fd766df1aeb060725/components/support) 
* Their ultimately orz book :pray: : https://mozilla.github.io/application-services/book 
* An old impl by 'em: https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-browser-architecture/experiments/2017-09-21-rust-on-android.html
* They automatically generate FFI bindings, for `crashtest`, see here: https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/components/crashtest/
* But they also have handwritten ffi bindings [@glean](https://github.com/mozilla/glean/)(deployed in production): https://github.com/mozilla/glean/blob/main/glean-core/ffi, study this FFI package
