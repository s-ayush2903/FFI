# FFI
Assembling resources to write an FFI with modern pracs. Ah just ignore it if you landed here for learning/discovering something new. It is trash as of now, check back later. Don't waste your precious time here :)

## Conclusion
Oh yeah, here is something that I concluded while browsing for FFI for Rust on android: Glean - https://github.com/mozilla/glean 
Read it in gh1s it'll be better and easy to handle a repository that expands to a Gig from ~146MiBs(unless you really need to run it locally, actually running it locally isn't needed, you can just follow the dots plotted in glean and then connect 'em on your own :P or maybe ask in their community forum, mozilla comm & enggs. are <3) :)
